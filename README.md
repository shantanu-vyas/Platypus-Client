# Platypus-Client

The code for the Platypus Tablet Client is extremley messy. This clutter causes alot of bugs, this repo is going to help recode a large portion of the app which can then be merged into the existing tabet repo.

To get an octave output from region
run:  javac *.java && java PathTest > output.m && octave --persist output.m


Bugs:
Spiral adds weird lines sometimes. ..should fix this eventually
